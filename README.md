# Psy-Cats: The Second Awakening
 Feline roleplaying that uses an narrative/emotion based system in order to convey exciting and mind-bending stories in a hidden world with themes of psychedelia, psychic-transhumanism, magic, mystery, and fantasy, all juxtaposed on a post-cyberpunk world in which technological-transhumanism has lifted the social elite well beyond traditional “godhood”.
